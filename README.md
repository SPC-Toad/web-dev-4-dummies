## How to Get Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, open a terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows) and navigate to the directory where you want to download the project. Use the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SPC-Toad/web-dev-4-dummies.git
```

Step 2: Navigate to the Project Folder
```bash
cd web-dev-4-dummies
```

Step 3: Install Dependencies
Once you're inside the project folder, you need to install all the necessary dependencies. Run the following command:
```bash
npm install
```
This command will download and set up everything you need to run the project.

## How to Upload Your Work to GitHub
Step 1: Create a New Branch
Before making changes, it's best practice to create a new branch for your work. To create and switch to a new branch, use this command:
```bash
git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
```
Replace <your-branch-name> with a descriptive name for your branch. (E.g. hello-world)

Step 2: Commit Your Changes
After making your changes in the code, stage them using:
```bash
git add .
```
Next, commit the changes with a meaningful message:
```bash
git commit -m "HTML tutorial"
```
Make sure your message describes what youâ€™ve done in this commit.

Step 3: Push to Your Branch
Now, you need to upload your changes to the branch you created. Run the following command:
```bash
git push origin <your-branch-name>
```
Again, replace <your-branch-name> with the name of your branch.


## Switch to the Main Branch
To switch back to the main branch, use this command:
```bash
git checkout main
```

## Working on a project
Please 'git pull' if possible to be updated.
